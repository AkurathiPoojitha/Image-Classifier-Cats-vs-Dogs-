# Image-Classifier-Cats-vs-Dogs-
This project implements a Cats vs Dogs Image Classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch. The model is trained on labeled image data, learns visual features automatically, and predicts whether a given image is a cat or a dog. It demonstrates basic deep learning and computer vision concepts.
